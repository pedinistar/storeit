Group Routes or Route Groups
using ()

/app
    /(auth)
        /sign-in
            -page.tsx
        /sign-up
            -page.tsx

Route : http://localhost:3000/sign-in
Route : http://localhost:3000/sign-up


Route Groups also allows us to add a new special file called layout.tsx
/app
    /(auth)
        -layout.tsx
        /sign-in
            -page.tsx
        /sign-up
            -page.tsx

layout.tsx allows us to show some shared UI or functionality across all of the pages with-in the route group
